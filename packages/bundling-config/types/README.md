# Plugin typings

This is a temporary method of typing options.
Since this will eventually be written in TypeScript, we still can create our own Typings.

To refresh them, edit [index.ts](./index.ts), then, from the CLI, update.

    ../../../node_modules/.bin/tsc --emitDeclarationOnly --declaration index.ts
